|   1    | Blowing multicolored bubbles which rise lazily     |
|   2    | Hopping up and down, dancing and splashing         |
|  3--4  | Ribbiting away, the tune jaunty and hopeful        |
|   5    | Fiddling with their hat, adjusting the way it sits |
|   6    | Chewing, talking to itself with a full mouth       |
