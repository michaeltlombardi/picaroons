Whenever you take the time and space to relax in relative safety for at least one week, you are
resting. After you rest, you may fill or swap out any of your tricks.

## Recovering HP

Whenever you rest, roll your HD. If the result is higher than your current HP, that's your new
total. Otherwise, +1 to your current HP, up the combined face value of your HD.

Roll 2d6. If the result is 2 or 3, increase your current HP to 4. If it's higher, set your current
HP to the result.

## Spending Marks

After you rest, you may clear your marks.

If you have at least as many marks as the size of their associated die, you may clear that many
marks to increase your die size one step.

In addition to increasing a die size, you may clear marks to:
