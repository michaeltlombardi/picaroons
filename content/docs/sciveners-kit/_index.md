> A Narrative Game of Adventure for Scoundrels

What is this? The _Scrivener's Kit_ is a box of ideas, thoughts, and advice for anyone who might want to facillitate a game using _Picaroons_. It's the my best attempt at being useful while staying out of your way.

Facillitating games is, I think, both art and skill; and while there are things you can learn from books like this one, you don't _need_ them. Experience and experimentation and conversation will carry you as far or further.

So use everything or anything or nothing. This book has no more say over your game than you decide it does; you're the player and the game is yours. I'm excited for you!

You can also buy _Picaroons_ on itch, where it is itchfunding!
