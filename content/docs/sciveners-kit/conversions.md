There's a ton of material out there you could adapt or convert or straight up use when playing with the _Picaroons_. Here's some thoughts on how to do so.

## Entities

To convert most old school creatures and NPCs for _Picaroons_, note their HD.

Two options work well:

1. When acting, add half their HD (rounded up) as a bonus to their d6 roll. For example, an HD5 Ankheg would roll d6+3.
2. Grant them domains that make sense to you. Feel free to wing it. If you'd like a bit more structure, add a domain or step one up for every HD they have.

Finally, give them any tricks that make sense. Most abilities and powers can be represented with tricks.

For pre-converted creatures and characters, check out _The Encyclopedia Picaresque_.

## Items

Largely, _Picaroons_ doesn't care much about equipment. Having pitons and rope might obviate a test to climb a cliff if the climber isn't being shot at, a lantern lights the surrounding area, etc.

If an item is important or intricate enough to be worth tracking in more detail, treat it as a domain. If it grants special abilities (as with magic or esoteric tech), write up a trick the bearer can use. For a plethora of items as domains with tricks, check out _Tools of the Trade_.

If an item granted bonuses in an old school style game, distribute that bonus amongst die steps for the domain and/or die count, step, and uses for any related tricks. Otherwise, just jam it to fit or leave it as is.

As items-as-domains can be lost, broken, or taken, they should not count towards a Picaroons domains when spending marks for a new domain.

As for costs, here's some ideas:

- 2d6s as base cost for an item as domain
- x10 for each die step
- +d6s for each trick
  - +d6s for each trick die, die step, and use
- If you're not bothering to convert the item, twice it's gold cost in silver

## Spells

There are two broad categories of spells to convert: levelless and levelled. Levelless spells work as tricks without much further munging. Just tie the effect to the trick die and you're done.

Levelled spells might take a bit more finagling. Tie the most important aspect of the spell's effect to the trick dice and/or write the trick such that it can split the trick dice amongst different knobs and levers (like target count and efficacy).

For using levelled spells without conversion, instead of automatically casting you might:

- Have the Picaroon make a test and set the TN to 4+ the spell's level
- Have the Picaroon make a contested roll against the spell, where spells 1-3 are d6, 4-5 are d8, 6-7 are d10, and 8-9 are d12
