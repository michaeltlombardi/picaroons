> A Narrative Game of Adventure for Scoundrels

What's this? The _Scrivener's Kit_ is a box of ideas, thoughts, and advice for anyone who might want
to facillitate a game using _Picaroons_. It's the my best attempt at being useful while staying out
of your way.

Facillitating games is both art and skill. While there are things you can learn from books like this
one, you don't _need_ them. Experience and experimentation and conversation will carry you as far or
further.

So use everything or anything or nothing. This book has no more say over your game than you decide
it does. You're the player and the game is yours. I'm excited for you!
