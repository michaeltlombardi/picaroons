An old woman sent you to return her son from the "haunted forest"--he left more than a week ago seeking some strange plant he _swears_ grows there which will cure his father's withering blight. Neither of his parents hold much hope in that. She pressed a small bag of coins into your hands (60s), promising you the deed to her family's modest estate if you could just bring him home safely.

Now, two days later, you've found him on the southern road into the forest, wandering aimlessly, his face ripped ragged, wearing nothing but a cloak of fir leaves, babbling incoherently. As soon as he is in sight (d6):

| Result | Event                                                                                     |

|   1    | The baying of wolves erupts from very near, to the north                                  |
|   2    | An ominous hooting grunt arises from the north east, echoing strangely                    |
|  3-4   | Lightning strikes the young man, leaving him unscathed but his cloak smoking              |
|   5    | Pilgrims flee from the north in abject terror, bloody and empty handed                    |
|   6    | The winds whisper harshly: "Elliasa hungers" and the moon rises uncannily above the trees |

For the rest of this adventure, see [Dungeons & Possum](https://twitter.com/DungeonsPossums)'s _The Forest_, found on [his blog](https://dungeonsandpossums.com/2021/12/dicember-2021-days-6-11/). This picaresque deposits the characters at the first fork in the road from the south with paths west to point 4 (Spoor), north to point 5 (Spoor), and east to point 6 (Ruined Homestead).
